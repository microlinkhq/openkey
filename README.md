**openkey** is:
  - Authentication & rate limit control for HTTP, backed by Redis.
  - Cheap at any scale, portable to any cloud. No vendor lock-in.
  - Developed to be used millions of times every day.
  - Designed with the best ractices for readability.
  - Heavily tested, with pitfalls preventions.

## Installation

You can install it via npm:

```sh
$ npm install openkey
```

**openkey** orbits around three concepts:

- **Plans**: Represents the quota, rate limit, and throttle information specified as a plan.
- **Keys**: Represents the credentials used during the authentication step and which plan is associated.
- **Usage**: Keep track of how much plan is available and consumed with the associated key.

## FAQ

### Why?

Until **openkey**, we use AWS Gateway feature for keys and plans for years. Although it was doing the job, it forced us to send all [api.microlink.io](https://api.microlink.io) traffic to AWS first for the control traffic, and then travel back to origin servers. We wanted to avoid that hop to provide a more responsive service.

### Is it a AWS Gateway replacement?

No, and we are not aspiring for it. We used to use a very specific feature present in the AWS Gateway service, and **openkey** is a replacement for that features.

We wanted to own the authentication & rate limit of our service. AWS Gateway can still do a lot of more things that this library.

### Why not TypeScript?

This library is intended to be used millions of times every day. We wanted to have granular control as much as possible, and adding a TypeScript transpilation layer isn't ideal from a performance and maintenance perspective.

### Why Redis?

We needed a backend layer fast for frequent writes, cheap at scale and mature enough for preventing vendor-lock in. We considered other alternatives such as SQLite, but according with this requeriments Redis is the no brain selection.

### Why key/value?

Originally this library was implemented using [hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes), but then since values are stored as string, it's necessary to cast value (for example, from string to number). Since we need to do that all the time, we prefer to use key/value in combination with JSON.parse/JSON.stringify. It makes the code tinier and easier to read.
